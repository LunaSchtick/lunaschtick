# LunaSchtick

This is the working site directory for the LunaSchtick writing and comedy project.

## Purpose

Commentary, comedy, and character-based content under LunaSchtick. 

## Structure

- `index.html` – Home page with welcome copy and nav
- `about.html` – Author background and project context
- `archive.html` – Running list of live articles
- `contact.html` – Direct email contact
- `article-template.html` – Reusable file for publishing individual posts
- `style.css` – Sitewide design (typography, color, layout)
- `script.js` – Optional interactive features (tooltips, punchlines)
- `README.md` – Project instructions

## How to Add a New Post

1. Duplicate `article-template.html`
2. Rename the file to your post title (use hyphens, e.g. `target-parking-lot.html`)
3. Fill in your title, date, content
4. Add a link to the new file in `archive.html` under the `<ul class="post-list">` section

## Notes

- This project runs fine in Replit, can be hosted with GitHub Pages or any static host.
- Backup manually as needed. No auto-sync or dependency files.
- CSS and JS are optional—core content loads without them.
